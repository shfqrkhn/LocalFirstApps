# MPES Implementation Plan

Status: revised 2026-07-22 after full adversarial audit. This is an A6 execution plan. The private `MPES-LocalFirstApps-Unified-v1.1.0.md` is the A1 prime product authority; explicit owner amendments in `DECISIONS.md` govern final CommonGround-branded LifeOS/WorkOS convergence.

## Non-Negotiable Architecture

- Two primary product shells: CommonGround LifeOS and CommonGround WorkOS.
- One invisible OmniCore source layer for design primitives, validation, explicit interchange, app-scoped PWA/storage/recovery, time, errors, and test utilities.
- No suite database, hidden cross-app reads/writes, universal service worker, implicit sync, backend, telemetry, account, provider key, or remote AI dependency.
- Preserve every current route, store, export/import, migration, and compatibility path until its replacement passes parity, recovery, rollback, accessibility, offline, and owner-acceptance gates.
- Ship in independently reversible packets. No feature packet may bypass an open safety blocker.

## Ordered Delivery

### R0 — Contain confirmed safety defects

Scope: make PMQuiz and Noodle workers cache-prefix safe; replace Noodle `new Function` formulas with a schema-validated allowlisted interpreter; remove `unsafe-eval`; make Noodle shell staging fail closed. Add cross-app cache sentinels, formula positive/negative vectors, CSP checks, and offline/update/recovery browser tests.

Gate: all foreign caches and stores survive every lifecycle/reset path; no executable imported/config content; incomplete candidates never activate; existing data and scoring fixtures remain compatible. Rollback is code-only and leaves app data untouched.

Result: **VERIFIED_LOCAL** on 2026-07-22. Runtime commit `6301bc2` contains the fixes; exact parity covers 42 rules across 10 assessments, and worker/browser tests cover malicious formulas, foreign-cache/store survival, complete staging, explicit activation, offline restart, staging faults, and last-known-good recovery. Publication is `NOT_RUN`.

### R1 — Establish trustworthy source, content, CI, and design foundations

Recover TS-Dash readable source and reproducible output or specify a behavior-first rewrite. Add third-party/license inventory. Correct Flexx icons and enforce manifest dimensions. Reconcile versions from one source. Split candidate checks from post-deploy checks and publish only a constructed runtime artifact. Create CommonGround tokens, typography, spacing, color, focus, form, dialog, status, navigation, responsive, reduced-motion, and error primitives without centralizing app data.

Create item-level provenance/review schemas for PMQuiz, Noodle assessments/content, and strength guidance. Remove/downgrade unsupported endorsement, psychometric, clinical, and prescriptive claims pending qualified review.

Gate: reproducible clean build; deterministic artifact inventory; licenses complete; CSP/icon/version/artifact tests pass; WCAG-oriented keyboard/pointer/touch/zoom/reduced-motion checks plus a documented manual AT matrix; no visual parity regression.

Result: **VERIFIED_LOCAL_WITH_LIMITATIONS** on 2026-07-22 in commit `620dbdd`. Source recovery found no readable TS-Dash source, so four generated artifacts are hash-frozen behind a behavior-first rewrite contract. The candidate gate builds a deterministic curated 123-file runtime and passes dependency/license/SBOM, CSP, icon, canonical-version, 3,868-record content ledger, 41-duplicate-group, local behavior, visual, file-mode, and automated accessibility checks. Unsupported user-facing content claims were softened. Manual AT/domain/content review, postdeploy execution, and publication remain `NOT_RUN`; no app/store/format/route was migrated.

### R2 — Build OmniCore by extraction

Promote only already-proven pure contracts: schema validation, hashing/portable transfer, scoped PWA/cache ownership, storage transactions, timestamps, recovery receipts, error/result types, design primitives, and test fixtures. Version each public module and give each shell an adapter. Do not create a framework before a second real consumer proves the abstraction.

Gate: CommonGround and one second app consume each promoted contract; old formats round-trip byte/semantically as specified; fault injection proves atomicity, idempotency, stale-write rejection, and foreign-scope preservation.

### R3 — Complete CommonGround LifeOS

Use HealthOS Focus as the shell seed. Fix preference restore atomicity. Rewrite Noodle as Reflection using inert validated assessment definitions and pure scoring. Extract Flexx domain math/storage into Strength modules, then replace its global UI/controller incrementally. Add meditation/breathing only after M3A owner acceptance; keep C25K, mobility, sleep, and later modules inactive until separately accepted.

Gate per migrated module: exact data inventory; dual-read/verified-write or explicit previewed file migration; backup before mutation; replay-safe receipt and rollback; route/store/export parity; offline/PWA isolation; non-diagnostic language; one-input and AT evidence. Keep the old surface available until owner acceptance.

### R4 — Complete CommonGround WorkOS

Refactor CommonGround facilitation/Decision Analysis into the WorkOS shell without changing matter-type boundaries, hard constraints, revisions, imports, or Ledger compatibility. Rebuild TS-Dash as Insights from recovered source/behavior contracts. Move PMQuiz into Learning only after content governance, deduplication, provenance, and deterministic session/recovery design. Add Knowledge as an explicit user-controlled source library, not hidden aggregation.

Gate per module: behavioral and format parity, exact-preview transfer, scoped storage/reset/PWA, accessibility, offline recovery, content provenance, and owner acceptance. Generic analysis must never infer causality or professional advice.

### R5 — Converge and retire safely

Make LifeOS and WorkOS the only primary launcher cards after every module reaches parity. Compatibility URLs remain lightweight redirects/migration surfaces. Deprecation requires usage/migration evidence, complete export, tested restore and rollback, owner approval, and a dated removal decision. Archive source only after the final supported release window; never archive required migrations or format readers.

Gate: no stranded data, broken bookmarks, duplicate authority, foreign-cache mutation, or unowned content; repository ZIP contains only curated runtime; archive manifest is complete.

### R6 — Release and operational closure

Run the full local suite, independent security/privacy/license/accessibility/content review, clean-install/upgrade/rollback/offline/quota/multi-tab tests, `git diff --check`, and protected PR checks. Publish only with explicit authority. Verify the exact deployed commit and all routes from a fresh and an upgraded profile. Record limitations and recovery drills; keep GitHub Releases absent unless separately approved.

Definition of 100%: all MPES requirements are mapped to passing evidence or an owner-accepted explicit non-goal; no P0/P1 defect is open; source is readable/reproducible; two coherent shells replace primary app sprawl; all retained data/contracts/routes recover; content and third-party provenance are reviewable; accessibility and offline behavior have both automated and manual evidence; documentation authority/state match the deployed commit.

## Next `/goal` Prompt

`/goal Complete LocalFirstApps R2 OmniCore extraction after verified R1. Reconcile live authority/state first and preserve every route, store, record, schema, import/export, worker scope, offline behavior, and compatibility path. Promote only already-proven pure contracts with a second real consumer: validation/result errors, hashing and explicit portable transfer, scoped PWA/cache ownership, timestamps, recovery receipts, design primitives, and test fixtures. Give each promoted module a minimal semver API, ownership/failure contract, app-owned adapter, dependency/license record, deterministic unit/fault tests, and rollback path. Do not create a suite database, global event bus, universal worker, hidden cross-app read/write/sync, framework wrapper, or speculative abstraction. Keep TS-Dash opaque artifacts frozen; do not begin its rewrite, LifeOS/WorkOS UI migration, M3B, content approval, route retirement, or publication. Prove CommonGround and one independent second app consume each extracted contract without data migration; old formats round-trip byte-for-byte or semantically as specified; malformed/quota/partial/replay/stale/concurrent faults fail atomically; foreign stores/caches survive; local-file and offline behavior remain intact. Update decisions, state, contracts, evidence, handoff, and risk register only to observed facts. Run npm run ci:candidate, npm audit --audit-level=moderate, git diff --check, and clean-status gates; make bounded local commits only.`

Do not start R3 until R2 is locally verified and reviewed. Later packets must be regenerated from current state.
